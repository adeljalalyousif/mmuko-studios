## Overview

MmuoKọ Studios reimagines game distribution through an **Inverted Customer Model** - where traditional retail channels (GameStop, CEX, online vendors) serve as discovery platforms that ultimately benefit both consumers and creators.

## Our Philosophy

### The Inverted Customer Model

```
Traditional Model:
Studio → Publisher → Retailer → Consumer

MmuoKọ Model:
Consumer ← → Retailer ← → Studio
         ↓
    Trust & Value Flow
```

Consumers discover our games through trusted retailers, creating a sustainable ecosystem where:
- Players find games through familiar channels
- Retailers maintain their role as curators
- Studios receive fair compensation
- Trust flows through the entire system

## Age-Conscious Game Development

### Core Principle: Witnessed Growth

Even when mature content appears in games (like a character in a bikini in GTA or magical beings), the key is **contextual consciousness**:

- **Parental Witness**: Games designed knowing parents may observe
- **Natural Development**: No forced narratives, organic story progression
- **Safety Through Design**: Age-appropriate presentation of all content

## Studio Divisions
